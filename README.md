In this project, we have a combined cycle composed of one gas turbine and one steam turbine that we know the atmospheric and some other conditions. So, we determine:
<li> The air-fuel ratio in the first combustor, the adiabatic flame temperature and other states temperatures; </li>
<li> The fuel mass flow rate and the flue gases mass flow rate for the specified electric power; </li>
<li> The Combined thermal efficiency; </li>
<li> Design of the Waste heat recovery boiler.</li>
